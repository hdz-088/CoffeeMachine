# CoffeeMachine

The Coffee Machine program is designed to simulate the operations of a real-life coffee machine. It interacts with users, accepts their orders, checks inventory levels, and prepares coffee accordingly. If the inventory is insufficient to fulfill an order, the program notifies the user about the shortage.

## Key Features:

- **User Interaction:** The program prompts users to input their coffee preferences, such as the type of coffee (e.g., espresso, latte, cappuccino) and the quantity.
- **Inventory Management:** It maintains the inventory levels of essential ingredients like water, milk, coffee beans, and cups. Before preparing any coffee, the program checks whether there are enough resources available.
- **Order Processing:** Upon receiving an order, the program verifies the inventory status. If there are sufficient resources, it prepares the coffee and deducts the required amounts from the inventory. If not, it informs the user about the shortage.
- **Error Handling:** The program includes error handling mechanisms to deal with invalid inputs and unexpected situations gracefully. It provides clear and concise error messages to guide users.

## How to Use

- You can check for Inventory by using "report"
